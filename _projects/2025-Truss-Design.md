As part of a class project we were tasked with designing a truss to lift the heaviest possible weight with the largest range of motion.

I designed it using the RSH piston to help get the maximal range of motion and force considering the design constraints of it needing to be inclosed in a 1.5 x .5 meter box. As you can see in the image, I designed a triangular looking truss piece to help maximize the torque on the weight and get the full range of motion within the space.
