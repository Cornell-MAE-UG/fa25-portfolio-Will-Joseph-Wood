My name is Will Wood, and I am a sophomore in mechanical engineering minoring in materials science. I specialize in mechanical properties of materials and structural analysis. I am the welding lead on steel bridge as well as on the eboard of maker club. I also work in the MLS machine shop assisting students with their projects for their project team.
